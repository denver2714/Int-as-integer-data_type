# Int-as-integer-data_type
This project provides a custom integer type in C++ with added features and optimizations compared to the standard int type.

FEATURES

-Arithmetic Operations: Easily perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo with Int objects.

-Comparison Operators: Use ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >= to compare Int objects.

-Input and Output: Read and write Int values using cin and cout.

-Compound Assignments: Supports +=, -=, *=, /=, and %=.

-Pointer Management: Includes functions to safely delete pointers to Int objects.


BENEFITS

-Flexible: Offers more control and custom behavior than the standard int type.

-Optimized: Designed for better performance in specific use cases.

This custom Int type is a great tool for projects needing extra features and optimizations beyond what the standard int type provides.


This is just to improve my C++ knowledge
